## Git repository for R package Bolstad 

This repo has is where I archive all my work on the R package Bolstad. Those of you who want to access the bleeding edge version of the code can do so here at your own peril. The *Latest build and source* directory will contain the latest source code build and a binary for OS X. It is only latest in that it is the last one I made. It will not be a daily build. However you can grab the code from the *src* directory if you want.

Any feedback is welcome. Please email me at: j.curran@auckland.ac.nz
